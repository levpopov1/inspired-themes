# Inspired Themes

Inspired Themes is a React app for creating UI themes from inspiring artworks.  
The app uses a Node.js and MongoDB backend (REST API) to serve existing theme data and their corresponding images.

The project is still in active development and many more features are currently being worked on. 
These include the ability to create your own theme from an image, ability to customize an existing theme,
export any theme as CSS and much more.
